# sql_challenge
Final version of the Module 9 Challenge
Notes: 
1 - The Schema that I included does have the tables out of order (I had to run the code one section at a time in an order that is different than they appear in the sql code). 
2 - The first time I ran my schema from the QuickDtabase tool I used to sketch the database relationships ran without errors, but I needed to rebuild the Database in pgAdmin in order to include a more complete Schema file. This is when I began to encounter errors
