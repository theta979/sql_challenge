# sql_challenge
*Update: //////////////////////////////////
My original submission was missing a critical file (SQL_schema.sql). The most recent commit added that missing file and renames the file containing the queries (renamed SQL_queries.sql - previously named: schema.sql). 

As I mentioned before, I experiencied some difficulties uploading the csv files to the tables due to uploading them out of order. Once I resolved that issue, I unintentionally uploaded the project without that schema file (intending to reorder them in the file). This commit will complete the submission and allow the Module challenge to run correctly.

Final version of the Module 9 Challenge
Notes: 
1 - The Schema that I included does have the tables out of order (I had to run the code one section at a time in an order that is different than they appear in the sql code). 
2 - The first time I ran my schema from the QuickDtabase tool I used to sketch the database relationships ran without errors, but I needed to rebuild the Database in pgAdmin in order to include a more complete Schema file. This is when I began to encounter errors
